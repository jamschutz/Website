                thank you for submitting :)
            </div>

            <div class="Blog-paragraph"><p>
                your next assignment, is your final assignment :')
            </p></div>

            <div class="Blog-paragraph"><p>
                it's to make a short (3-4 minute) pitch presentation for a game of your own design, to be given next week -- it can be anything you want, whatever ideas are exciting you right now.
                you can work solo, or in pairs, though it has to be a <i>new</i> game (i.e. not something you are already working on!). 
                this is your oppotunity to dream a game into existence, with no obligations to ever create it! i encourage you to follow what you are passionate about. this is your game! you can make anything!!
            </p></div>

            <div class="Blog-paragraph"><p>
                you can pitch for any format: digital, tabletop, VR, performance art, whatever; and can be for any size team (AAA, indie, you name it) -- there is no scenario where i will say "bUt iS tHiS rEaLlY a gAmE??" so don't get caught up in that! just pitch what excites you.
            </p></div>
            
            <div class="Blog-paragraph"><p>
                as for your presentation, there's 20 of us so do try to keep it to 3-4 minutes, and focus on the "what" and the "why." gives us a concrete picture of what your game is, what's interesting or special about it.
                don't worry about budget, scope, team, production details etc -- just focus on the core concept / idea!
            </p></div>

            
            
            <div class="Blog-paragraph" style="margin-bottom: -15px;"><p>
                <b>some tips :)</b>
            </p></div>

            <div class="Blog-paragraph"><p>
                remember to include basic info about your game (like is it single- or multiplayer), as well as gameplay, art style, narrative, etc.
            </p></div>

            <div class="Blog-paragraph"><p>
                i encourage you to include at least one <i>specific gameplay example</i> for your game -- it just helps the audience really understand the particulars of your design,
                and helps us to understand if your design is going to work or not (help us "see it in action").
            </p></div>

            <div class="Blog-paragraph"><p>
                you want <i>some</i> text to help us understand the high level ideas, but not <i>too much</i> (like blocks) of text -- make sure you aren't just reading off your slides!
            </p></div>

            <div class="Blog-paragraph"><p>
                have fun :)
            </p></div>

            
            
            <div class="Blog-paragraph" style="margin-bottom: -15px;"><p>
                <b>in the event you *really* do not want to present</b>
            </p></div>

            <div class="Blog-paragraph"><p>
                if you don't want to present your game, you can instead just submit a 2-3 page design document explaining your game. include visuals for art or gameplay references, etc.
                and in class i'll just quickly go through your doc so you don't have to present (i think it will be much better for you to present, but i won't make you if presentations
                really stress you out! but just be ready to answer any questions we have :)
            </p></div>

                as i said at the top, this will be your last assignment for this class. it's been a joy spending time together each week thinking, talking about, making, and playing games.
                i can't say enough how proud and impressed i am with all of your work, with your commitment to play, and (most importantly) with your commitment to each other as a community. 
                thank you for making this a great class :) i am excited to see what all of your individual games are!! 
                it's your chance to make your <i>own</i> "dream" game (like we listed for roblox), and i can't wait to see what you cook up üë®‚Äçüç≥ remember to have fun with it!
            </p></div>
